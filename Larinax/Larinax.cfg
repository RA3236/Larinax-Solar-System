			description = When Kerbal astronomers found this star so close to Kerbol, they celebrated. Not because that they did something useful for once, but because they failed to notice the eight planets in orbit of this small red dwarf star. Strangely, this star for some reason has a magnetic puslar that gives solar panels a huge boost in power when near the star (apparentley 200km away). It is unknown why this happens.
